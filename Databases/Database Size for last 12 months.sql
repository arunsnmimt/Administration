-- Get the average full backup size by month for the current database (SQL 2012) (Query 60) (Database Size History)
-- This helps you understand your database growth over time
-- Adapted from Erin Stellato

-- The Backup Size (MB) (without backup compression) shows the true size of your database over time
-- This helps you track and plan your data size growth
-- It is possible that your data files may be larger on disk due to empty space within those files
